# MarkovianBaseball
 This code takes a Markov's Chain approach to calculating the runs expected in various situations in baseball. 

*Disclaimer there's part of the code in here that's obviously not mine. When I wrote this code I needed an inverse method and was having the hardest of times finding one.
